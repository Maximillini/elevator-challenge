The challenge is intentionally open-ended but the rules you must follow are below:

- 20 floor building
- Elevator can go up and down
- Elevator can go to a specific floor
- Display the current floor of the elevator
- Display whether or not the elevator is moving
- Display whether or not the elevator doors are open or closed
- Tenants on a random floor will call the elevator every 10 seconds
- When tenant requests elevator, they will choose if they are going up or down
- Elevator should follow normal logic. For example, if the elevator is already going up to floor 10 and a tenant on floor 8 requests to go up, the elevator should stop at 8 to pick up that tenant.

Let us know if you have any questions. 

## Nextjs Instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
